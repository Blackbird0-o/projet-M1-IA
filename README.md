# projet-M1-IA

Project of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Course link : https://krzakala.github.io/ml_P6_2019_web/

The goal is to identify the stars that have exoplanets orbiting them based on the light flux collected by Kepler telescope during Camapaign 3. Kaggle project link : https://www.kaggle.com/keplersmachines/kepler-labelled-time-series-data and github of the creator : https://github.com/winterdelta/KeplerAI

We have one month to try and get the best results possible. The idea is not to win the kaggle project but simply to explore all the tools of ML and to be confronted to a real ML problem.
